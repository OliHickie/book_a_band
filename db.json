Those days of romance: glamour, moonshine and tuxedos, the excitement of Harlem and invention of wild, new dance crazes.  Think wartime tunes made famous by Duke Ellington, Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald and Glenn Miller. \r\n\r\nThen there are the mid-century classics that everyone knows - Frank Sinatra, Doris Day, Dean Martin; and even the occasional tune from Stevie Wonder, the Beatles, Billy Joel, or the achingly cool Astrud Gilberto.  Great melodies that have been sung by everyone from Rod Stewart to Michael Buble to Robbie Williams … \r\n\r\nThe Cutting Edge Big Band has been performing around Oxford since 1982 and is now led by Chris Macklow, a man of easy vintage charm and smooth sophistication. His apparently laid-back style hides a ruthless attention to detail."

        "content": "The build up to your walk down the aisle is enormous. For many brides, the moment they step down the aisle is the moment their wedding really starts, it’s what everything has been building towards, and so it’s only natural that you want it to be nothing short of perfect. Getting your wedding ceremony music right will play a big part in this, so here are the dos and don’ts you need to get it just right.\r\n\r\nDO set the mood\r\nYou don’t need us to tell you that your wedding day will be emotional and romantic. Just as you’ll likely choose a song that is filled with these emotions for your first dance, do the same for your wedding ceremony music. It can be instrumental, but it does need to enhance all those magical things you’ll be feeling as you walk down the aisle to your future husband or wife!\r\n\r\nDON’T feel like you have to stay traditional\r\nWhile a pianist or organist might be tradition (and very beautiful), they aren’t your only options. Other live musicians to consider are harpists, soul choirs or even a live band. Don’t discount recorded music, either, just make sure the songs you choose are appropriate in lyrics and length.\r\n\r\nDO make it ambient\r\nWhatever wedding ceremony music you choose, make sure it’s ambient and comfortable for listeners. Consider the volume – you don’t want anything too loud – and make sure the pace is slow and calming. This will help keep your groom relaxed and give you a natural rhythm to match as you walk down the aisle towards him.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDON’T make a last minute decision\r\nThe song you just absolutely fell for on the radio last week might seem like the perfect choice, but stop and really think about it before you choose it for your wedding day. How often do trendy songs come and go? How often do you listen to them so many times you fall out of love with them? You don’t want this to be how you remember your wedding ceremony, so approach the latest tunes with care and try not to make a last minute decision if you can help it.\r\n\r\nDON’T forget to pick a song for your walk out, too\r\nSo far, all we’ve been thinking about is what music you will walk down the aisle to, but what about when you exit the church as newlyweds, otherwise known as your recessional music? Make sure you choose a musical accompaniment for this too, it’ll be the first walk you take as a married couple so you want it to be atmospheric and memorable.",

        "content": "Are you considering a band at your wedding? It all sounds so simple until you realise just how varied they can be. We’ve rounded up the best advice to help you when choosing a live band.\r\n\r\nChoosing a Band for Your Wedding\r\nWhy have a band?\r\n\r\nDepending on the length of your reception, you may not want a DJ for the whole of it. A live band adds a certain level of interaction and engagement that draws out the best in people. Throwing a band into the mix breaks up the evening with a little more action.\r\n\r\n“Live music from good musicians has an infectious enthusiasm, especially at such a happy occasion,” Says Charlie Talbot, manager of Oompah Brass.\r\n\r\nWhat type of band?\r\n\r\nWhether you want a stationary or roaming band will add time to your search. Roaming bands are harder to come by but all the more entertaining because of their crowd engagement. You’re more likely to find a New Orleans style brass band or a Bavarian brass band, such as Oompah Brass who roam as they perform.\r\n\r\nBrass bands, in particular, are louder and more impactful acoustically. As a result, you may not have to require a PA system to amplify the sound of your band (unless you’ve got over 200+ guests).\r\n\r\nWhat about the appearance? \r\n\r\nIt depends if you want your band to blend into the background or to stand out and really entertain. With a brass band, not only does the music entertain but the instruments with their florid designs and shapes can really add to the show.\r\n\r\nWhat type of music?\r\n\r\nThere’s a whole world of various bands out there to choose from. From soul to jazz, brass to basic cover bands, it’s safe to say we’re spoilt for choice. You need to think about the percussion and style you like most before filtering through bands and sending endless enquiries.\r\n\r\nWhen do you book the band for?\r\n\r\nBands are most commonly booked for the reception, to really kickstart the party and get guests up on their feet. Pull together a playlist of songs that are sure to have your guests busting a move and the band will make the magic happen.\r\n\r\nCharlie Talbot, tells us of the different and varied options for when to introduce the band (particularly great if they’re a roaming brass):\r\n\r\n“Processing between the ceremony and reception venue, being followed down the street by all the guests,” he says and we can’t help but imagine what a great wedding photo that will be.\r\n\r\n“Playing fanfares as guests clutch their first glass of champagne, playing background music during receptions and… keeping a dance floor jumping long into the small hours”. \r\n\r\nHow much should you budget?\r\n\r\nThere’s usually a minimum performance time of an hour but typically people tend to book for a couple of hours before a DJ. We would recommend you budget from £800 – £3,000 for a live band. The greater the number of instruments, the greater the cost.\r\n\r\nHow far in advance should I book?\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible, the wedding season is a busy time for musicians.\r\n\r\n“As with venues, caterers and everything else, the sooner you book, the more relaxed you can be. Summer weekends get booked up quickly so you need to know the availability of your options a long way in advance,” Says Charlie.",
